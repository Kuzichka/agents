Playing Around with Jade (http://jade.tilab.com/)
=================================================
This project is to illustrate and document the basic patterns of usage of Jade.

The initial setup is Windows specific. This is because I am trying to do this on a Saturday
and Jade installs and works better out of the box on my Windows laptop than my mbp.

Setting up Jade
---------------
Follow instructions on web page then create setenv.bat

Creating Jade agents
--------------------
Create a class
Put it in a jar file
Add jar file to classpath

Typical Usages
--------------
java jade.Boot -agents John:examples.peter.PeterAgent

Args are inside (). Claims to support space separated args but on ever reports 1 arg
Fails if no "". Condenses to single arg if there are ""
java  jade.Boot -agents "John:examples.peter.PeterAgent(arg1 arg2 arg3)"

BookTrading examples
--------------------
Each instance running on same computer needs to use a different port. Will try counting backwards
from defautl port 1099

C:\java\jade>java jade.Boot -agents "Big-Bad-John:examples.bookTrading.BookBuyerAgent(War-and-Peace)"
....
Hallo! Buyer-agent Big-Bad-John@192.168.0.4:1099/JADE is ready.
Target book is War-and-Peace

java jade.Boot -agents "Gentleman-Jim:examples.bookTrading.BookSellerAgent(War-and-Peace)"


Second buyer

java jade.Boot -port 1098 -agents "Big-Bad-John:examples.bookTrading.BookBuyerAgent(War-and-Peace)"
